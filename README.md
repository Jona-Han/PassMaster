# PassMaster

## 1. Summary

**This project stores account login information.** All of the username and password combinations can be accessed after logging in using a master username and password. All data is stored and encrypted onto the local file system. Specific information for an account is unencrypted only when needed.

This project is interesting to me because it allows me to practice implementing object-oriented design. In addition, I want to learn how to design and implement methods to ensure data security. In this age, keeping data secure and out of the hands of any potential threat actors is of key importance. People log in to many applications and expect personally identifiable information to be protected. They expect their data to be kept privately and securely. I want to gain a basic understanding how this can be achieved.

## 2. Technologies used
- JSON : data is stored in JSON form. JSON was chosen since it is a very-widely used data format when exchanging data through the web. 
- JUnit : The JUnit library was used in order to practice **test-driven development** practices
- Swing : The Swing library was used for the UI. This was chosen due to its maturity and big library of GUI
