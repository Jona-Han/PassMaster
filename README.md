# Password Manager Project

## 1. Summary

**This project stores account login information.** All of the username and password combinations can be accessed after
logging in using a master username and password. Login information is stored and encrypted onto the local file system.
The project then decrypts the stored information to provide to the user.

Anyone who needs a secure way to store their login information can use this application.

This project is interesting to me because it allows me to learn and implement object-oriented design. In addition, I
want to learn how to design and implement methods to ensure data security. In this age, keeping data secure and out of
the hands of any potential bad actors is of key importance. People log in to many applications and may have personal 
information attached to their account. They expect their data to be kept privately and securely. I want to 
understand how this is done.
